## Introduction

Hey there! This is my first blog post on this site. Working off of my previous decade of experience, 
I have a vested interest in seeing how Terraform would work on my infrastructure. This post is short and sweet but will detail a large portion of what I wish to accomplish.
The final product for learning Terraform is the ability to enter a command and fully deploy different LXC containers and Virutal Machines that are custom tailored .

Currently the setup goes as this:
   - Custom i7-12700k Proxmox Host
        Intel Core i7-12700k
        64GB of Ballistix RAM
        Gigabye 1080Ti 11GB
        2TB of SSD storage
        Mellanox ConnectX-3 NIC (Networked over a p2p connection to my C6525)
   - Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525
        Dual Epyc 7002 64 Core 128 thread processors
        128Gb of ECC SK Hynix RAM
        15TB combined of NVMe storage and SATA SSDs
        Mellanox ConnectX-5 EN 25GbE (Networked p2p to my i7-12700k host)

Updates will be posted most likely every day when I work on my project.
